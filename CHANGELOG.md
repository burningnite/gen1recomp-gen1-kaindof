## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Trainer levels scaled to (average player team level) + random(1 to 3)
  (capped at 100), applied to every roster in each trainer class's parties list.
- Trainer parties padded to 6 with varied species themed to the trainer's
  class, closed by one surprise ace one level above the old strongest.
- Competitive RBY movesets for ~55 species, carried by the trainer.party
  hook (registry party slots are schema-strict) and gated to level 25+ so
  endgame TM sets never appear on early-route trainers.
- The first rival battle is exempt and stays vanilla (one starter).
- Each encounter zone's rare slots (grass and water) replaced with fresh
  progression-tier species, never duplicating the zone's natives.
- Wild levels raised by a flat, static +2 (capped at 100).
- Competitive trainer AI via the battle.enemy_action hook: merged-type-chart
  damage scoring with STAB, immunity avoidance, effect-classified move
  roles (fixed damage scored by real damage, status spreading, low-HP
  healing, situational setup, Explosion held until near-KO), with vanilla
  fallback for item/switch turns and multi-turn locks.
